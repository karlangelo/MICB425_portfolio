#### Learning objectives

* Discuss the relationship between microbial community structure and metabolic diversity
* Evaluate common methods for studying the diversity of microbial communities
* Recognize basic design elements in metagenomic workflows

#### General questions

* What were the main questions being asked?  
    + What are the specific functions and physiological roles of  Proteorhodopsins (PR) derived from marine microbial?
    + What is the physiological basis of light-activated growth stimulation in bacteria containing the PR photosystem?
    
* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
    + Functional screening of metagenomic libraries of marine picoplankton large-insert genomic to create fosmid library 
    + High-density colony macroarrays to make recombinant clones expressing PR photosystems in vivo
    + Sequencing of clones and genomic analysis 
    + Carotenoid Extraction 
    + HPLC Analysis
    + Proton-Pumping Experiments 
    + ATP Measurements

* Summarize the main results or findings.  

    + 6 genes (s, Ô¨Åve encoding photopigment biosynthetic proteins and one encoding a PR) is needed to have a fully functional PR photosystem 
    + 

* Do new questions arise from the results?  

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?
